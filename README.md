# KTH_Framework
This repository binds together [KTH_Examples](https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Examples) and [KTH_Toolbox](https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Toolbox),
which together provide useful tools for simulations using NEK5000 and demonstrate their usage.
A compatible version of NEK5000 is also included as a submodule.

Besides for providing practical tools, [KTH_Toolbox](https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Toolbox) also defines a convenient framework for developing new ones.
For example, it makes it easy to define new parameters for users to set in the `.par` file; time and report execution of selected blocks of code, etc.

Documentation is generally provided in files called `FRAMEWORK.txt`.
Here, these are compiled using Doxygen and published on the Github pages.
You are therefore encouraged to continue reading there if you are interested in learning more!
