@mainpage Framework for toolboxes developed for Nek5000

@section intro Introduction
This framework provides platform for development and shearing the tools based on [Nek5000] 
(https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/) code. It contains number of utilities that allow Nek5000 users to perform 
additional tasks. The main objective is to allow different users to exchange their code that is not 
part of Nek5000 core but operates through standard user interface (mainly through \a userchk). 

@section structure Framework structure
To make this platform easy to expand and reuse existing code we introduce specific directory structure
representing different tasks. All files are grouped by taks and placed in a tree structure, where 
the parent directories (modules in Doxygen nomenclature) perform some operations and can define tasks 
and interfaces that have to be provided by their subdirectories (submodules). This structure can be repeated 
recursively with submodules becoming parent modules for next level structures. A backbone of the whole framework
is module called [frame] (@ref frame) that provides dynamical databases for all tools (modules), runtimes parameters
and timers introduced by framework. This module should be started first and all the remaining tools should 
be registered with it. For more information check [Toolbox page] (@ref toolbox).

@section download Download 
The top level direcotries in the framework point to stable release of three main github repositories (using 
[git submodules] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)): 
- [Nek5000] (https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000),
- [toolbox] (https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Toolbox),
- [tool examples] (https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Examples).

Each ot these repositories can be downloaded separately by executing
@verbatim
git clone https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000.git -b master
git clone https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Toolbox -b master
git clone https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Examples -b master
@endverbatim
or as a single framework by
@verbatim
git clone --recursive https://github.com/KTH-Nek5000/KTH_Framework
@endverbatim 

The second method is preferred as Nek5000 repository has neither development nor stable branches and all the 
development goes directly to master branch. As stable releases are marked by tags the user has to be careful 
to clone Nek5000 version compatible with current tool version. On the other hand the submodule within 
KTH_Framework points to the speciffic commit in Nek5000 repository forcing consistency between tools and 
Nek5000 versions. For the same reason user has to be careful using
@verbatim
git submodule update --remote Nek5000
@endverbatim
as it would load all the new commits. The proper way of upgrading KTH_Fremwork is running from the main 
framework directory
@verbatim
git fetch
git merge origin/master
git submodule update --recursive
@endverbatim 

@section documentation Documentation
To make this platform easy to use we pay attention to [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) 
based documentation of every tool. It has to provide detailed description of the tool itsef, 
the routine interfaces, runtime parameters and possible dependencies between modules. The general 
description of every tool is given in [FRAMEWORK.txt] (@ref toolbox), which is present in almost every 
directory. This documentation is available online as GitHub Pages (gh-pages bfranch) and can be generated 
locally by executing at the top level of the local copy of KTH_Framework repository:
@verbatim
mkdir html
doxygen ./docs/Doxyfile
rm doxygen.warning
@endverbatim
It requires doxygen 1.8.11 or newer and the dot tool from [Graphviz] (http://www.graphviz.org/). 
All files required by doxygen are located under ./docs/. It includes configuration file (Doxyfile), bibliography
(doxy.bib) and web pages contents (mainpage.dox). 

@todo Add possibility to generate documentation in KTH_Toolbox separately.




@page runtime_parameters_page Runtime parameters for KTH framework.

@section rparam_file Runtime parameter file.
An important issue for our framework is organised structure of runtime parameters that would allow for 
simple modiffication of parameter list without introducing conflicts between different code parts.
As old \a setup.rea file does not provide sufficent flexibility, all tool developers are obligated to use 
new  \a setup.par file instead, as it organises runtime parameters by sections and in addition to 20 user
parameters in \a [GENERAl] section allows to introduce user defined sections.
Every section starting with underscore is treated as user section and its consistency is not checked by Nek5000
core code. Following examples shows two native  Nek5000 sections and three user sections:

@section rparam_module Module's runtime parameters.
We utilize user defined sections in \a setup.par to set values of runtime parametes defined in different modules. 
To simplify interaction between different tools the [frame] (@ref frame) module provides dynamical database of 
all available runtime parameters in the framework. To provide requred information to the framework we introduce 
the module registration phase and split if from the module intialistation. All these steps are performed by 
[frame_start](@ref frame_start), which initialises the framework itself and next calls a user interface \a frame_usr_register. 
This routine shoud be placed in \a setup.usr and contain calls to the module registration routines. The registration 
of the module consists of signing up the module in the database followed by the runtime parameters definitions 
(name, type, description and default value) and finalised with timers definitions. This information is used to check 
consistency of the \a setup.par file and to fill in runtime parameter database. Next user defined \a frame_usr_init 
is called by [frame_start](@ref frame_start). It initilises all the modules by calling their initialisation routines. 
This operation consists of taking back updated values of runtime parameters from the database and performing requred 
by the module addtional operations.  

Following example shows the way a statistics module is initialised:
@code{.f90}
!======================================================================
      subroutine userchk
      implicit none
      include 'SIZE'            !
      include 'TSTEP'           ! ISTEP, lastep, time
      INCLUDE 'INPUT'           ! IF3D, PARAM

      if (ISTEP.eq.0) then
!     start framework
         call frame_start

!     set volume flow parameters
         param(54) = uparam(1)
         param(55) = uparam(2)
      endif

!     monitor simulation
      call frame_monitor

!     for statistics
      call stat_avg

!     finalise framework
      if (ISTEP.eq.NSTEPS.or.LASTEP.eq.1) then
         call frame_end
      endif
     
      return
      end
!======================================================================

      subroutine frame_usr_register
      implicit none

      return
      end subroutine

      return
      end subroutine

      subroutine frame_usr_end
      implicit none

      call stat_end
      
      return
      end subroutine
!======================================================================
@endcode

Each tool has to provide routines for registration, intialisation and finalisation of the given module. 
[chkpt_register] (@ref chkpt_register) and [chkpt_init] (@ref chkpt_init) are good example of them.

Dependencies between different modules can be expressed as a tree structure, which we would like to follow
in our database. That is why each module during registration has to specify its parent, which can be its real
parent module (for submodules) or FRAME module (the first module registered by frame). In a similar way we 
specify parents for timers.

The list of all defined parameters, their dafault values and dependency between different modules are described in 
following pages:
